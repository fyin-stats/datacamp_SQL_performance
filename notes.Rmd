### Chapter 1 

Consistent formatting

\begin{itemize}
\item Be consistent
\item Use UPPER CASE for all SQL syntax
\item Create a new for each major processing syntax: SELECT, FROM, WHERE, etc.
\end{itemize}

Indent code: sub-queries, on statements, AND/OR conditions

Complete the query with a semi-colon (;)

Alias where required, using AS

commenting blocks, /* */, -- 


#### Aliasing
Used in queries to identify tables, columns, subqueries; temporary, only applied when the query is run; make sthe query easier to read, may be required. 

why: avoid repetitive use of long table or column names, easily identify joined tables and share the same name

make sure the alias consistent and easy to read

#### Query order
the processing order of the main SQL syntax is different from the written order in the query.

Syntax order: SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY;
Processing order: FROM, WHERE, SELECT, ORDER BY;

Processing errors

Logical processing order, FROM, ON, JOIN, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, SELECT, DISTINCT, ORDER BY, TOP


### Chapter 2 - Filtering and data interrogation

#### Filtering with where
Note where is queried before select

applying functions to columns in the WHERE filter condition could increase query time, should try to make your query simpler, for example, like 'Georgia'

#### Filtering with HAVING
FROM, WHERE, HAVING, SELECT

Don't use having to filter individual or ungrouped rows; having, for a numeric filter on grouped rows 

GROUP BY, HAVING SUM() 

Do not use HAVING to filter individual or ungrouped rows,

#### Interrogation after select
Processing order after SELECT


SELECT TOP 5 PlayerName,
       Team, TotalPoints
FROM ...

TOP 1 PERCENT

The other row limiters: TOP + ORDER BY (MSFT SQL Server), ROWNUM + ORDER BY (Oracal), LIMIT (ORDER BY PostgreSQL)

use ORDER BY with caution, use ORDER BY in a query: to interrogate the data, when there is a good reason for the final returned results to be sorted. 


#### Managing duplications

Removing dupliates with DISTINCT, we can also use GROUP BY instead.

Removing duplicates with UNION

If want to keep them all, use UNION ALL. Use with caution, calls an internal sorting under the hood.


### Chapter 3 - Sub-queries

Sub-query with FROM. 
Sub-query with WHERE. 
Sub-query with SELECT. 

Types of sub-query. Correlated sub-query. Uncorrelated sub-query can be run in parallel. Correlated sub-query references the outer query. 

#### Presence and absence

Presence:

SELECT CustomerID
FROM Customers

INTERSECT

SELECT CustomerID
FROM Orders;


Absence:
EXCEPT



#### Alternative methods 1

EXISTS (SELECT 1 ...)

IN

EXISTS VS IN, Exists will stop searching the sub-query when the condition is TRUE, IN collects all the results from a subquery before passing to the outer query.

NOT Exists, NOT IN

The way NOT IN handles NULL values in the sub-query


#### Alternative methods 2
INNER JOIN, LEFT OUTER JOIN, RIGHT OUTER JOIN.

### Chapter 4 - Query performance tuning
Statistics TIME in SSMS, CPU time, elapsed time. 

CPU time: time taken by server processesors to process the query
elapsed time: total duration of the query.

SET STATISTICS TIME ON

Comparing queries.

Elapsed time, may be variable when analying query time statistics.
CPU time, should vary little when analyzing query time statistics (might be larger than elapsed time when query is run in parallel). 

#### Page read statistics
can also look at the performance with respect to memory usage. SQL server works with pages cached in memory. 

SET STATISTICS IO ON

Logical reads. 

#### Indexes

\begin{itemize}
\item Structure to improve speed of accessing data from a table.
\item Used to locate data quickly without having to scan the entire table.

\item Useful for improving performance with filter conditions.
\end{itemize}

Clustered index: dictionary. table data pages are ordered by the column with the index. speeds up search operations. B-tree structure. 

Nonclustered index: improves insers and update operations. 


SELECT *
FROM Cities
WHERE CountryCode IN ('JM','NZ') -- Country codes


#### Execution plans
Optimization phase, processor usage, memory usage, data page reads

Index example, search from table with or without clustered index.

<!-- ## Including Plots -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo=FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. -->
